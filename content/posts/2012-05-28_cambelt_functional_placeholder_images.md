[Cambelt](http://cambelt.co) is a neat placeholder image service Iâ€™ve discovered recently. It introduces some interesting features over its competitors, like custom fonts, or ability to generate icons and simple images. Be sure to check out the [example page](http://cambelt.co/#simple-examples). There is also a Ruby gem, but it seems to me *overengineered*.
