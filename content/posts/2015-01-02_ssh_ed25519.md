[ED25519][1] is a high-speed high-security public-key signature system.  It uses elliptic curve cryptography and it is supported by OpenSSH since 6.5.

ED25519 generates small keys of 32 bytes and allows fast single-signature/batch verification, very fast signing and fast key generation.

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

ED25519 should be prefered over RSA, DSA and ECDSA.
