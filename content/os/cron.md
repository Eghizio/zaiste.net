# Cron

Every user on a system may have their own crontab file.

```
undefined
``` files are usually located under ```
undefined
```.

The ```
undefined
``` file is system-wide.

The ```
undefined
``` directory may contain cron files. Some Linux distributions have ```
undefined
``` directories

```
undefined
``` specifies users who cannot use cron.

cron daemon will not catchup and run past queries in a case of the system being off (powered off or the daemon being stopped).

cron logs the actions via syslog (either ```
undefined
``` or ```
undefined
```).

## crontab

In the crontab file you cannot use ```
undefined
``` to extend a command over multiple lines.

cron requires that commands are terminated with a new line, including the last line.
