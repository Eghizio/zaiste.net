    **before**

     the argument file (designated by 

    ```

    ```

     in 

    ```

    ```

    )

     is the current file matching the 

    ```

    ```

    ```

     command line is built by appending each selected file name at the end; the total number of invocations of the 

    ```
    undefined
    ```

     command will be much less than the number of matched files.
