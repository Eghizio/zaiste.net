* How To Resolve Redis' ~MISCONF~ Error

Here's the error:

#+begin_quote
MISCONF Redis is configured to save RDB snapshots, but is currently not able to
persist on disk. Commands that may modify the data set are disabled. Please
check Redis logs for details about the error.
#+end_quote

It means that Redis is not able to save data on the disk. This error occurs
because of BGSAVE being failed. During BGSAVE, Redis forks a child process to
save the data on disk.

Redis doesn't need as much memory as the OS thinks it does to write to disk, so
may pre-emptively fail the fork.

Set ~vm.overcommit_memory~ to ~1~ in the ~/etc/sysctl.conf~:

#+begin_src bash
vm.overcommit_memory=1
#+end_src

And then, restart the ~sysctl~ process:

#+begin_src bash
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
#+end_src

*Important*: Setting the ~stop-writes-on-bgsave-error~ option to ~no~ in Redis *doesn't*
 solve the problem, it just ignores it.
