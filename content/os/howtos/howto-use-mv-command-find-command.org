* How To Use ~mv~ Command with ~find~ command in Linux

#+begin_src bash
find . -name '*<pattern here>*' -exec mv -t desination/ {} +
#+end_src

+ ~-t~ specifies the destination path *before* the argument file (designated by
  ~{}~ in ~find~)
+ ~{}~ is the current file matching the ~find~ command criteria
+ ~+~ the ~find~ command line is built by appending each selected file name at the
  end; the total number of invocations of the ~mv~ command will be much less
  than the number of matched files.
