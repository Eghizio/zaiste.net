# How To Set Colors for Priorities in Org Mode

Customize ```
undefined
``` to set specific attributes for each priority:

```elisp 
'((65 :foreground "red" )
  (66 :foreground "orage")
  (67 :foreground "blue"))
```

The numbers 65, 66 and 67 correspond to the priority letters in ASCII e.g. 65 is A. This can be also written as ```
undefined
``` in Emacs Lisp.
