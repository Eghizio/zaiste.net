#+title: Self

* Self

Self was first announced in 1987.

Self has no classes only prototypes.

Self makes no distinction between member access and method calls.

The term `prototype` has a different meaning in Self than it has in
Javascript.

Self parent slots are built-in delegation. They can be used for inheritance
(traits), they can be used for sharing implementation (mixins) or they can be
used in the general context of composition

NewtonScript is a descendent of Self. It introduces the concept of frames, dual
inheritance hierarchy and the Soup object database.

Self's JIT was influential and was the forerunner to Java JIT research.

Self had multiple code generators.
