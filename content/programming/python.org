[[http://nuitka.net/][Nuitka]] is a Python compiler. It is compatible with Python 2.x and 3.x.  It
translates Python code into a C program that then is linked against ~libpython~ to
execute in the same way as CPython does. With Nuitka you can compile Python programs
(and all needed modules) to standalone binary files.
