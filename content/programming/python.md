# Python
[Nuitka](http://nuitka.net/) is a Python compiler. It is compatible with Python 2.x and 3.x.  It translates Python code into a C program that then is linked against ` libpython` to execute in the same way as CPython does. With Nuitka you can compile Python programs (and all needed modules) to standalone binary files.
