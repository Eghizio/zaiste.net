# Common Lisp

[FSet](https://github.com/slburson/fset) functional library for Common Lisp for a better experience.

Compile-Time Computing.

Rigetti uses Common Lisp to build [compilers](https://github.com/rigetti/quilc) and simulators for quantum computers.

SBCL stands for Steel Bank Common Lisp.

In SBCL, there is ```
undefined
``` which can be put at the top of a function and the compiler will give useful feedback when it canâ€™t optimize something and suggest type hints to improve performance.

[ABCL](https://abcl.org%20) is a Common Lisp on the JVM.

Common Lisp makes binding to C libraries easy via CFFI or via things like[cl-autowrap.](https://github.com/rpav/cl-autowrap)

Common Lisp can build a self-contained binary, thus easier to deploy.

[pgloader](https://tapoueh.org/blog/2014/05/why-is-pgloader-so-much-faster/) got rewritten from Python to Common Lisp.

## Python Integration

It is possible to use Python libraries in Common Lisp via [py4cl](https://github.com/bendudson/py4cl).

## Web Development

[Weblocks](http://40ants.com/weblocks/) is a web framework for Common Lisp.
