* V8

V8 was designed to be multi-tenant. It was designed to run the code from the
many tabs in the browser in isolated environments and within a single process.

Node.js and similar runtimes were not designed for multi-tenant

** Isolates

Isolates are lightweight contexts that group variables with the code allowed to
mutate them. A single process can run thousands of Isolates, seamlessly
switching between them.

Isolates were designed to start quickly and to *not* allow one Isolate to access
the memory of another.

JavaScript runtime overhead is paid once. Then, Isolates allow to run
scripts with almost no individual overhead.

Isolates can start around a hundred times faster than a Node.js process on a
local machine. Isolates consume an order of magnitude less memory than that
Node.js process.

Isolates start in 5 milliseconds.
