* How To Disable A ~TextField~ in Flutter

Use the ~enabled:~ property of the ~TextField~ widget by setting it to ~false~:

#+begin_src dart
TextField(
  enabled: false,
  ...
)
#+end_src

This field won't respond to ~onTap~ events - it is similar to a disabled field
in HTML.

Use ~focusNode~ and ~enableInteractiveSelection~ to make a TextField in Flutter
readonly so that it can respond to the ~onTap~ events:

#+begin_src dart
TextField(
  focusNode: FocusNode(),
  enableInteractiveSelection: false,
  ...
)
#+end_src
