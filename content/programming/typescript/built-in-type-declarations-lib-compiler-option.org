* TypeScript's Built-In Type Declarations with the ~--lib~ Compiler Option


Since version 2.0, the built-in standard library type declarations have been
split into modules in TypeScript. This allows to select which (of those
built-in) declarations to include in the project.

There are several groups which can be defined with the ~--lib~ compiler option
(or via the ~lib~ property in ~tsconfig.json~):

+ dom
+ webworker
+ es5
+ es6 / es2015
+ es2015.core
+ es2015.collection
+ es2015.iterable
+ es2015.promise
+ es2015.proxy
+ es2015.reflect
+ es2015.generator
+ es2015.symbol
+ es2015.symbol.wellknown
+ es2016
+ es2016.array.include
+ es2017
+ es2017.object
+ es2017.sharedmemory
+ scripthost

By default, if not set explicitly, TypeScript will include type declarations
needed for web development, depending on the target:

- for ~ES5~ as target: ~dom~, ~es5~ and ~scripthost~
- for ~ES6~ as target: ~dom~, ~dom.iterable~, ~es6~ and ~scripthost~
