# Reason

Reason is a new syntax for OCaml.

Reason is transpiled to OCaml. The language is similar to ES2016.

OCaml can be transpiled to readable JavaScript via BuckleScript.

The project was initiated at Facebook.

[Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/) was created by Jordan Walke (the creator of React).

Cheng Lou from the React core team has created bindings to JavaScript React.
