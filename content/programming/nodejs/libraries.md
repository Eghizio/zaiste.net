## Routing

* [route-trie](https://github.com/zensh/route-trie) a trie-based URL router. Its goal is only to define and match URLs. It does not handle methods, headers, controllers, views, etc., in anyway. It is faster than traditional, linear, regular expression-matching routers, although insignficantly, and scales with the number of routes.
* [route-recognizer](https://github.com/tildeio/route-recognizer) - a lightweight JavaScript library that matches paths against registered routes. It includes support for dynamic and star segments and nested handlers.

## Database Integration

* [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) - the fastest fully featured PostgreSQL client for Node.js, 1250 LOC - 0 dependencies, ES6 Tagged Template Strings at the core, ‍️simple surface API
* [ley](https://github.com/lukeed/ley) - driver-agnostic database migrations
