#+title: Virtual DOM
#+ABSTRACT: Virtual DOM is an in-memory, data-structure cache for DOM.

Virtual DOM is ...

The DOM was often used to store state: this just isn't an efficient approach.

The DOM is fast, but page refreshes or reflows may be slow.

If a DOM manipulation is poorly conceived, this may lead to performace problems:
this idea gave birth to the myth that the DOM is slow.

The Virtual DOM is an improvement because it allows to consolidate multiple
changes into a single DOM operation.

With the 2 way bindings approach, changes could trigger many computations where
each would trigger re-renders. React bundles all such operations into a single
rerender.

~lit-html~ lets you write declarative UI without diffing. It has
an almost 1-to-1 correspondence with JSX, but by utilizing the static/dynamic
 split it doesn't have to do VDOM diffs.

Template Instantiation.
