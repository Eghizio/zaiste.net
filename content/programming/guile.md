# Guile

Guile is an implementation of the Scheme programming language. Scheme (and Lisps in general) are well suited for writing Domain Specific Languages. Guile is[homoiconic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity). It has a powerful object-oriented programming framework and it is optimised for immutability

Guile has **no** Global Interpreter Lock.

Guile doesn't have a particular overhead for calling functions which makes it possibly as fast as C.

Guile has pre-release of a new JIT with instant startup from native code caches.
