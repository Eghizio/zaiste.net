# Cloe

[Cloe](https://github.com/cloe-lang/cloe) is a Lisp-like, functional programming language. It provides immutable data, lazy evaluation along with implicit parallelism, concurrency, and reactiveness.

Cloe is inspired by Haskell's Time is Space concept and its lazy evaluation approach.

As with Clojure, everything is a value with no object system; it also uses a similar Lisp syntax.

From OCaml it borrows a syntax close to pure lambda calculus.

It is based on Go.
