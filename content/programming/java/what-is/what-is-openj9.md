# What is OpenJ9

OpenJ9 is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) implementation from Eclipse; an alternative to the default Oracle HotSpot JVM - the most popular JVM implementation.

OpenJ9 is based of IBM's Java SDK.

OpenJ9 is known for its memory management that is superior to the default HotSpot JVM. For that reason, OpenJ9 is suggested for cloud & container usage.
