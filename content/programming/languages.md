## Applicative Programming Languages

In applicative programming languages, the central construct is a function invocation. This function is applied to a set of parameters.

## Stack Programming Languages

In stack programming languages, any function invocation is done by using just the name of that function. Its parameters are implicit, they must on the stack when a particular function is invoked. The result of the function invocation is placed on the stack as well.

## Concatenative Programming Languages

In concatenative programming languages, computations are done by composing functions that operate on data being passed from one function to another one.

Concatenative programming languages are not necessarily stack languages.
