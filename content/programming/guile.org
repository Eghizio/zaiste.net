#+ABSTRACT: Guile is a high-level progrmaming language from the Lisp family.

* Guile

Guile is an implementation of the Scheme programming language. Scheme (and Lisps
in general) are well suited for writing Domain Specific Languages. Guile is
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity][homoiconic]]. It has a powerful object-oriented programming framework and it is
optimised for immutability

Guile has *no* Global Interpreter Lock.

Guile doesn't have a particular overhead for calling functions which
makes it possibly as fast as C.

Guile has pre-release of a new JIT with instant startup from native code caches.
