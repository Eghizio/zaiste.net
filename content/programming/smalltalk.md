# Smalltalk

Smalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed reflective programming language.

## If Statement

In Smalltalk, booleans (```
undefined
```) are objects (instances of the abstract```
undefined
``` class). Every boolean has the type ```
undefined
``` or ```
undefined
```, and no instance data; it also has the ```
undefined
``` and ```
undefined
``` functions. Those functions take a block of code as input. ```
undefined
``` overrides the ```
undefined
``` function so that it always runs the code provied as input while ```
undefined
``` does nothing. The same goes for ```
undefined
``` which overrides these two functions, but in reverse.

What other languages do with special syntax, Smalltalk does as a special case of method dispatching.
