[LambdaNative](https://www.lambdanative.org/) is a cross-platform development environment written in Scheme, supporting Android, iOS, BlackBerry 10, OS X, Linux, Windows, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD and OpenWrt. It is a wrapper and abstraction over Gambit Scheme. It does not support multi-core threading.

Racket is intended for Language-Oriented Programming.
