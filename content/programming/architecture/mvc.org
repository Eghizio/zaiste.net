* Model-View-Controller

Model-View-Controller is an architectural pattern for developing user
interfaces. The pattern was formulated by [[http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~trygver/index.html][Trygve Reenskaug]] [[http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~trygver/themes/mvc/mvc-index.html][in 1978]] while
visiting the Xerox PARC. MVC was conceived as a general solution to the problem
of users controlling complex data sets. Its first name was Model-View-Editor. It
later evolved into Model-View-Controller.

The essential purpose of MVC is to bridge the gap between the user mental model
and the digital model that exists in the computer.

Jim Althoff and others implemented a version of the MVC pattern for Smalltalk-80.
