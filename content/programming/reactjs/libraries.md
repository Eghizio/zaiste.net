## Routing

* [Reach Router](https://reach.tech/router/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/reach/router))
Reach Router is a small, simple router for React that borrows from React Router, Ember, and Preact Router. Reach Router has a small footprint, supports only simple route patterns by design, and has strong (but experimental) accessibility features.
