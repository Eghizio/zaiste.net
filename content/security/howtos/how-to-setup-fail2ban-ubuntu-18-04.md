# How To Setup fail2ban Ubuntu 18.04

Fail2ban is an application that parses the system logs looking for signs of an automated attack.

When an attack attempted is identified, Fail2ban adds a rule to iptables to block the IP address of the attacker. This block can be set either for a specific period of time or permanently. fail2ban focuses on SSH attacks.

Since fail2ban 0.9, the bans are persistent. fail2ban maintains a database at```
undefined
```.

## fail2ban: Installation

```shell 
sudo apt-get install fail2ban
```

## fail2ban: Configuration

The ```
undefined
``` contains the default configuration. It is a good practice to copy this file to ```
undefined
```. In fail2ban```
undefined
``` files override ```
undefined
``` files.

```shell 
cp /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.conf /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.local
```

The ```
undefined
``` file enables fail2ban configuration for SSH. Again, it is a good practice to copy this file to ```
undefined
```.

## fail2ban: Whitelist IPs

To make an IP ignored by fail2ban, use the ```
undefined
``` setting:

```shell 
ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 1.1.1.1
```

## fail2ban: Ban Time

Use ```
undefined
``` setting to set the number of seconds for which an IP is banned. If set to a negative number, the ban is permanent.

## fail2ban: Retry Time / Amount

Use ```
undefined
``` to set the number of seconds between login attempts before a ban is set. It is used in conjunction with ```
undefined
``` which sets how many attempts can be made to access the server from a specific IP before it is banned.

## fail2ban: SSH Settings

By default in fail2ban only SSH settings are enabled.

```bash 
[ssh]

enabled  = true
port     = ssh
filter   = sshd
logpath  = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 6
```

For ```
undefined
```, if using the default ```
undefined
``` port, the service name can be used. Otherwise, for non-traditional ports, use the port number explicitly.

## fail2ban: Regex

fail2ban uses regular expressions (regex) to parse log files in order to identify potential attacks. fail2ban uses Pythonâ€™s regex implementation.

Use ```
undefined
``` to check if your custom filter is working.

```bash 
fail2ban-regex /var/www/html/logs/access.log /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/wordpress.conf
```

## fail2ban: Command Line Client

fail2ban provides a command-line (CLI) tool ```
undefined
```.

-   ```
    undefined
    ```

     - start the fail2ban server and all defined jails.
-   ```
    undefined
    ```

     - reload the fail2ban configuration
-   ```
    undefined
    ```

     - reload a specific jail configuration
-   ```
    undefined
    ```

     - stop the fail2ban server
-   ```
    undefined
    ```

     - show the fail2ban status and active jails
