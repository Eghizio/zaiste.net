In this series we will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.
