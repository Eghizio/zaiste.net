## Notes

[org-journal](https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal) is an Emacs mode for journaling built on top of org-mode. It maintains a set of files for journaling per day, week, month or year. Journaling entries are the headings.

org-journal is included in Emacs Doom. You don't need to install it. Enable it in your `init.el` along with a simple configuration. Press `SPC n j j` to write your first journal entry.
