#+title: Wheat

* Wheat

Modern wheat is different than the wheat grown 100 years ago. Today’s wheat has
a protein content that is up to 90% gluten (~ 10x increase from the wheat of a
century ago).

The modifications of wheat have resulted in certain side effects - the
alteration of proteins within the wheat itself.

1. Gliadin (one of the main components of gluten) has taken on opiate-like
   characteristics, making consumers addicted to wheat.
2. Wheat germ agglutinin – another type of protein in wheat known as a lectin,
   which usually protects against bacteria – has also been altered and became
   toxic to the human digestive tract.

Wheat today also has a particular peptide strand that wasn’t present in ancient
wheat.
