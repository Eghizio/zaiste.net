* Sleep

Deep sleep allows our brains to function at a higher level: come up with ideas,
find solutions to puzzles quickly, identify patterns and recall information.

Lack of sleep can cause depression, sickness, reduces alertness and make
mistakes more likely.

People sleep significantly better and feel more alert during the day if they get
at least 150 minutes of exercise a week.

+ Dysania: the state of finding it hard to get out of bed in the morning.
+ Parasomnia: unnatural movements during your sleep.

Believing you have slept well, even if you haven't, improves performance.
