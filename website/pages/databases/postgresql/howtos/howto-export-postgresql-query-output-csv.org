* How To Export PostgreSQL Query Output as CSV

~\o~ puts the query output into file at given location. PostgreSQL must have
write privileges to that location.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

\f ','
\a
\t
\o /tmp/output.csv
#+END_SRC

~\f~ set field separator
~\a~ set output format unaligned
~\t~ show only tuples

Then, just run the query

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
SELECT * FROM widgets;
#+END_SRC

Another approach using ~\copy~

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
\copy (SELECT * FROM widgets LIMIT 10;) TO '~/path/on/filesystem/file.csv' CSV HEADER
#+END_SRC

+ queries must be single line
+ if the database doesn't have access to the filesystem, output to ~STDOUT~

It's required to quote the columns if there are timestamp fields in the DB.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
\copy (SELECT * FROM widgets ) TO '~/path/to/file.csv' DELIMITER ',' QUOTE '"' FORCE QUOTE * HEADER CSV
#+END_SRC

Command Line

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
psql -d dbname -t -A -F"," -c "select * from widgets" > output.csv
#+END_SRC

This method doesn't include column headers.
