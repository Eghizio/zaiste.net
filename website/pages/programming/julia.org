#+TITLE: Julia
#+ABSTRACT: Julia is a high-level general-purpose, dynamic programming language designed for high-performance numerical analysis and computational science.

* Julia

Julia is inspired by Lisp, Python, R, Fortran and C/C++. It is aimed at highly
scalable performant numerical and statistical computing while being easy to use
in a similar way as Python.

Its execution speed in many instances is equivalent with C, C++ or Fortran.

Intel Labs is a heavy user of Julia. They develop the ~ParticleAccelorator.jl~
library which adds an additional layer of optimization on top
of Julia's parallelization methods resulting.

Julia offers a performance similar to C while being higher level, similar to
Python or Matlab.
