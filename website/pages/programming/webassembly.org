* WebAssembly

WebAssembly is a portable, size- and load-time-efficient binary compiler target,
which promises near-native performance on the web.

WebKit has a full WebAssembly implementation. itâ€™s a low-level binary format
designed to be a suitable compilation target for existing languages such as C++

WebAssembly cannot do everything that JavaScript does. For example, WebAssembly
cannot access the DOM except by calling into JavaScript.
