* TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It provides optional types annotations.

TypeScript can help avoid common bugs by type-checking the code. It can use the
type system to help write code faster.

TypeScript allows to migrate from JavaScript gradually, i.e. on a file basis
using the ~--allowJs~ flag. As of TypeScript 2.3, it is possible to check
regular JavaScript files.

** Structural Types

TypeScript has structural types, in contrast with Java (which has nominal
types): interfaces are assertions about the shape of an object, rather than
things themselves.

** Configuration

+ ~allowSyntheticDefaultImports~ allows to use modules which don't define default exports
