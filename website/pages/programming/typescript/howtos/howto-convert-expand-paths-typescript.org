* How To Convert / Expand Paths in TypeScript

The ~baseUrl~ compiler option in TypeScript allows you to define import paths
relative to the path defined using that option:

#+begin_src json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src"
  }
}
#+end_src

TypeScript doesn't convert those paths to the actual file paths on the
filesystem as /Module names are considered resource identifiers and are not
changed by the compiler/.


Use [[https://github.com/grrowl/ts-transformer-imports][ts-transformer-imports]], a TypeScript transformer which enables compilation
of absolute imports (using baseUrl or paths) so they can be required as modules
from Javascript or TypeScript, without additional configuration or path mapping.
