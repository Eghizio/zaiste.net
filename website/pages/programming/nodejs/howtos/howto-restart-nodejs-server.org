* How To Restart a Node.js Server

First, start a server

#+begin_src js
const server = http.createServer(...);
#+end_src

Use ~chokidar~ to watch for file changes:

#+begin_src js
chokidar
  .watch('path/to/your/app/files')
  .on('change', path => {
    restart();
  });
#+end_src

In order to ~restart()~ a Node.js server, you must first shut it down by (1) [[file:howto-shutdown-nodejs-server.org][closing
all sockets]] and (2) by closing the server itself.

#+begin_src js
server.close(() => {
  start();
})
#+end_src

Lastly, you need to clear the cache of the ~require~ function by deleting the
keys corresponding to changed files.

#+begin_src js
delete require.cache[filePath];
#+end_src
