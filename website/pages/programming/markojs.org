* Marko.js

Marko.js is a lightweight, fast JavaScript UI library. It was created at
eBay.

Marko.js is an isomporphic UI: it can be used on the server or in the browser.

It is a general purpose HTML-based template engine on steroids: it can not only
render pages server-side (as streams), but it also allows to use (reactive)
components, similar to React or Vue.js.

Marko.js compiles templates to CommonJS modules. It supports async rendering
and custom tags.
