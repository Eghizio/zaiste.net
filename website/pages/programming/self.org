#+TITLE: Self

* Self

In Self, an object built to be set on a parent slot (and shared between multiple
sub-objects) will be called either a trait or a mixin (depending on its parent
chains, essentially).

"prototype" has a completely different meaning in Self than it has in
Javascript: a Self prototype is a mostly set-up object to copy, there is no
semantic relation between a prototype and its "instance" afterwards.

Self parent slots are no more and no less than built-in delegation. They can be
used for inheritance (traits), they can be used for sharing implementation
(mixins) or they can be used in the general context of composition (Go has
echoes of this in struct embedding).

NewtonScript is a descendent of Self. It introduces the concept of frames, dual
inheritance hierarchy and the Soup object database.


Self's JIT was very influential and was the forerunner to Java JIT research.

Self had multiple code generators.
