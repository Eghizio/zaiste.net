* Kawa

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/][Kawa]] is a programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine. Kawa is a
Lisp, specifically an extension of Scheme. It combines the benefits of dynamic
scripting languages such as fast and easy start-up, a REPL, no compilation step,
with the benefits of compiled languages such as fast execution, static error
detection and JVM integration.

Kawa is also a framework for implementing other programming languages on
the JVM.
