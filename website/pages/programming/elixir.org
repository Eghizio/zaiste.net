* Elixir

Elixir is built on the foundation laid by Erlang/OTP. It runs on a virtual
machine called BEAM.

The BEAM is built to run in a distributed fashion. It has its own scheduler and
a facility to spawn light-weight processes which are not OS threads. Those
processes are isolated and they communicate through message passing.

OTP (The Open Telecom Platform) was designed to build telecom systems at
Ericsson.
