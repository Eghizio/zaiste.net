#+TITLE:  Dark Lang

* Dark Lang

Dark aims to provide the quick prototyping of Python using their built-in editor
along with a language that comes with static types (similar to OCaml).

In Dark, types cannot be changed; only new types are made to replace the
previous ones.

Dark doesn't have ~null~s and exceptions.
