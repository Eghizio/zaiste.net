* Clojure

Clojure is a functional programming language for the Java Virtual Machine.

Clojure is entirely oriented around manipulating maps and lists.

Most sequences and functions are lazy by default.

** Threading Macro

This

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(->> task
     :state
     (map :status)
     (every? #(= % "yes")))
#+END_SRC

is more readable than this:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(every? #(= % "yes") (map :status (:state task)))
#+END_SRC
** Data Structures

Clojure's immutable data structures (lists, vectors, maps and sets) are not copy
on write. They're based on red-black trees: when you mutate the value, a new one
is created that shares everything but the mutated part with the original.
