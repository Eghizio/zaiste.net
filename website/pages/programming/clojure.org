#+ABSTRACT: Clojure is a functional programming language for the Java Virtual Machine.

* Clojure

Clojure is a functional programming language for the Java Virtual Machine.

Clojure is entirely oriented around manipulating maps and lists.

Clojure has consistent standard library.

Most sequences and functions are lazy by default.

Clojure is not statically typed, but it has Spec.

Idiomatic Clojure is slow compared to SBCL-compiled Common Lisp.

** Threading Macro

This

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(->> task
     :state
     (map :status)
     (every? #(= % "yes")))
#+END_SRC

is more readable than this:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(every? #(= % "yes") (map :status (:state task)))
#+END_SRC
** Data Structures

Clojure's immutable data structures (lists, vectors, maps and sets) are not copy
on write. They're based on red-black trees: when you mutate the value, a new one
is created that shares everything but the mutated part with the original.
