* How To Check if a Disk is an SSD or an HDD on Linux

** By using ~/sys/blcok~
Since the kernel version 2.6.29, Linux automatically detects SSD.

Verify the disk:

#+begin_src bash
cat /sys/block/sda/queue/rotational
#+end_src

~1~ = HDD / Hard Drive Disk
~0~ = SSD / Solid State Disk

It may not work if the disk is a logical device emulated by hardware e.g. a RAID
controller.

** By using ~lsblk~ from ~util-linux~

Use ~lsblk~ from the ~util-linux~ package:

#+begin_src bash
lsblk -d -o name, rota
#+end_src
#+begin_src bash
NAME ROTA
sda     0
sdb     0
sdc     1
#+end_src

~ROTA~ stands for /Rotational Device/. ~0~ = false, ~1~ = true.

** By reading random blocks

Read random blocks off the disk

#+begin_src bash
time for i in `seq 1 1000`; do
    dd bs=4k if=/dev/sda count=1 skip=$(( $RANDOM * 128 )) >/dev/null 2>&1;
done
#+end_src

This operation is slow on HDD (few seconds) while fast on SDD (under a second).
