** Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) - programs that learn from data and make predictions.

Types of predictions:
+ regression: continuous values
+ classification: discreet values or labels

Types of ML algorithms:
+ supervised: trained on labeled data (regression or classification)
+ unsupervised: trained on unlabeled data (clustering, segmentation)
+ reinforcement: learning based on outcomes/results of actions


Deep Learning: AI/ML using artificial neural networks (ANNs)

Types of ANN:
+ Dense Neural Networks (DNN)
+ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
+ Recurrent Neural Netowkrs (RNN)
