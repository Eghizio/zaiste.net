#+TITLE: Org Mode

* Org Mode

Org Mode is a major mode for Emacs. It is part of Emacs.

Org Mode was created by Dominik Carsten in 2003 as an organizer / outliner tool.

Org Mode can be used to create spreadsheets and LaTeX documents, to manage
tasks, to connect documents via hyperlinks.

Org Mode can run blocks of code and collect the output.

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-agenda-files
    (file-expand-wildcards "~/Notes/*.org"))
#+end_src

Show actually italicized text instead of /italicized text/.

 #+begin_src elisp
(setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t)
 #+end_src



** Org Agenda

You can export the agenda calendar with ~org-icalendar-export-agenda-files~ and
then load them into applications that read .ics files.

Use ~SPC a d~ for daily agenda.

Use ~SPC a t~ for tasks.
** Capture

Store new notes at the beginning of a file or entry:

#+begin_src bash
(setq org-reverse-note-order t)
#+end_src
