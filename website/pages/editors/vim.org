* Vim

Vim 8 added a native way to load 3rd party plugins. Thus, there is no need any
longer to use things like ~pathogen~.

Create ~/.vim/pack/<any-name>/start/~ - this will hold all plugins and Vim will
automatically pick up any packages added to this folder.

Optionally, ~/.vim/pack/<any-name>/opt/~ may be created for packages that won't
be loaded automatically. Those packages can be loaded manually using ~:packadd
<package-name>~.
