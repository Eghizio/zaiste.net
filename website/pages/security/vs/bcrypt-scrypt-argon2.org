#+title: bcrypt vs scrypt vs argon2

* brypt vs scrypt vs Argon2

- Prefer Argon2 over scrypt
- Prefer scrypt over bcrypt

** bcrypt

- it lacks memory hardness
- there is (some) interest in attacking bcrypt using hybrid ARM / FPGA SoCs

** scrypt

- scrypt has memory hardness as part of its design
- scrypt memory hardness is tied to a single scalar cost factor
- scrypt iteration count is tied to a single scalar cost factor

** Argon2

- Argon2 won the PHC in 2015
- Argon2 is built around AES cipher and most modern x86_64 and ARMv8 processors
  implement an AES instruction set extension
- Argon2 is resistant to ranking tradeoff attacks
- Argon2 allows to parametrize the memory hardness, the CPU hardness and a
  parallelism factor
- Argon2 has three different implementations: Argon2d, Argon2i and Argon2id
- Argon2d is computationally expensive and resistant to acceleration by GPUs,
  FPGAs, and ASICs with limited memory bandwidth
- Argon2i selects memory addresses independently of the password. This reduces
  its resistance to GPU cracking, but eliminates the side-channel attack.
- Argon2id is a hybrid approach: the 1st pass uses the Argon2i and subsequent
  passes use the Argon2d
