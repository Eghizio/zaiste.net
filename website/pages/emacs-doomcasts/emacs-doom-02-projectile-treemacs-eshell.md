  In this series we will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by
  default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the
  keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages
  discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs
  Doom provides only some sane defaults.
